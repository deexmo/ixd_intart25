# Chapter 2 DOET

When reading Chapter 2, one of the things that stood out to me was the distinction between slips and mistakes. After learning about this, it made me realize the sort of errors I make with my car's touch screen. Sometimes I “slip” and click the wrong icon or setting because some of the elements are positioned close together.

That doesn't happen as often as the “mistakes” I make though. There are plenty of times, even still to this day, that I am trying to change a setting, but find myself cycling through all the menu options to find that particular setting. It is very unclear which option to go to for various settings. For example, if I am trying to change one of the driving features, I don't know if I am supposed to go to navigation, security, or autopilot. And when I do eventually find it, I don't remember where I need to go in the future for that same setting. I find myself cycling the options again. Reading this made me realize how easy it is to make both types of errors when the design doesn’t clearly separate functions. It’s not the user’s fault. It’s a problem of how the system is designed to communicate.

I also found the idea of knowledge in the world vs. knowledge in the head interesting. It made me think about apps I use on my phone. Some require too much memory, while others give clear and more importantly memorable visual cues that guide me. Some things just become second nature to use. And other good designs make it easy for that thing to become second nature to you. I agreed strongly with Norman’s point that good design doesn’t just make objects functional, it makes them intuitive and reduces frustration.
