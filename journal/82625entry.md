# Chapter 1 DOET

Overall, Chapter 1 highlights how critical it is for designers to respect the user’s perspective and thought processes. Instead of expecting people to learn how to use unfamiliar and confusing systems, design should just generally make it easier for people. After reading Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things, it really reinforced the idea of good and poor design.

Users cant be the ones to blame themselves for struggling with a product. The real issue is probably poor design. This is why Norman’s discussion of user-centered design vs. blaming the user stood out to me. Good design should anticipate human error and provide clear signals to guide the user, rather than leaving them confused. Sometimes I would think, “Why can’t I figure this out?” But now, I understand that it's the design itself that was the problem.

Another topic that caught my attention was feedback, the information a system gives about the results of our actions. I remember a time I pressed an elevator button and wasnt sure if it was working because there was no feedback. So it showed me how important that little light is to let you know that it is working. When feedback is clear, it reassures the user and builds confidence. I think this is why video games are so engaging. When feedback is clear and immediate, it makes the experience much more enjoyable for players. For example in shooting games, when a player hits a target, the game often provides immediate feedback through visual effects and sound cues, making the action feel satisfying and reinforcing successful gameplay. Chapter 1 highlighted that design should adapt to people, not the other way around, and small improvements in usability can make daily interactions much smoother.

Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AP56_uk5fFg) of good feedback. There is bullet impact, a hit marker, sound effect, and increasing stats. This makes it satisfying even from just viewing it.
