# Chapter 1 DOET

After reading Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things, it really reinforced the idea of good and poor design. Users cant be the ones to blame themselves for struggling with a product, when the real issue is probably poor design. This is why Norman’s discussion of user-centered design vs. blaming the user stood out to me. Good design should anticipate human error and provide clear signals to guide the user, rather than leaving them confused. I’ve often thought, “Why can’t I figure this out?” But now, I understand that it's the design itself that was the problem.

Another topic that caught my attention was feedback, the information a system gives about the results of our actions. I remember a time I pressed an elevator button and wasnt sure if it was working because there was no feedback. So it showed me how important that little light is to let you know that it is working. When feedback is clear, it reassures the user and builds confidence. I think this is why video games are so engaging. When feedback is clear and immediate, it makes the experience much more enjoyable for players. For example in shooting games, when a player hits a target, the game often provides immediate feedback through visual effects and sound cues, making the action feel satisfying and reinforcing successful gameplay. Chapter 1 highlighted that design should adapt to people, not the other way around, and small improvements in usability can make daily interactions much smoother.

Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AP56_uk5fFg) of good feedback. There is bullet impact, a hit marker, sound effect, and increasing stats. This makes it satisfying even from just viewing it.

Overall, Chapter 1 highlights how critical it is for designers to respect the user’s perspective and mental model. Instead of expecting people to adapt to confusing systems, design should adapt to people. I came away thinking more critically about the tools I use every day, and how even small improvements in usability could reduce frustration and improve experiences.
