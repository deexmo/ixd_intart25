# Chapter 4 - Part 2

This part of the reading made me think about how much design affects our everyday lives without us realizing it. The idea of skeuomorphism, which is practically making new technology look or behave like old technology, stood out to me. I never thought about why digital folders look like paper folders or why early cars copied horse carriages. It just seemed normal or like thats how it was supposed to be. I realize now that is just the result of a good seamless design. It also makes sense that familiar designs make people more comfortable with change.

The section about electric vehicles caught my attention the most because I drive one. I’ve noticed my car makes almost no sound at all especially at low speeds, but I didn’t know there were government standards and committees deciding what EVs should sound like. I also never thought about how that can be for blind pedestrians or people who rely on hearing traffic to stay safe. I realize now those sounds are very important for that reason. It’s almost ironic that after years of trying to make cars quieter, we now spend time and money adding noise back in. 

Overall, the text made me appreciate how thoughtful design really is. Even something as small as a beep or hum goes a pretty long way for safety, psychology, and user experience.
