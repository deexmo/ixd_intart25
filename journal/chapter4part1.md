# Chapter 4 - Part 1

After reading Chapter 4, I realized how much thought goes into designing even the simplest everyday objects. When he talks about the constraints, it helped me realize why designs can feel intuitive while others can feel frustrating. It was also interesting to hear about the legacy problem. For instance, changing a simple object like a battery or a key requires updating millions of products, and I am sure companies often don't make changes that don’t directly impact sales. I also found the sections on cultural and activity-centered constraints particularly interesting. Cultural norms show that design is also about context and shared understanding. He talks about the color of brake lights and how to behave in a restaurant. 

The first part of chapter 4 also gives several everyday examples of poor design that really show how frustrating bad design can be. Light switches are an example. Rows of identical switches can make it nearly impossible to know which controls which light. When it comes to light switches, I had a bad experience with the lights in class. I remember trying to turn one on, but I pressed the wrong button. In fact, it wasn’t even a button, it was the indicator light showing that the switch was on. The actual switch was located underneath what I had tried to press. The other examples he provides show that even simple objects can cause user errors and confusion when designers fail to consider constraints, natural mappings, or signifiers.
